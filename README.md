## How to run?
Go to the `server.py` archive in `src/` and type in the terminal
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
it will install the dependencies used in the project
after that, while using python 3.10, type in the terminal
```
python3 server.py
```
it will activate the localhost server that you can use to navegate through the website and test adding things
since the debug is activated it will show in real time, unless you mess up with something, so you will need to restart.
